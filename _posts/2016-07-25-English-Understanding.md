## 关于 Receive 和 Retrieve

A common spelling rule in English for the sequence of "i" and "e" is often stated as:

- "**_i_** before **_e_** except after **_c_**," meaning that "ei" is commonly used after the letter "c."

For example, in the word "receive," the "**c**" is followed by the "**ei"** combination. On the other hand, in the word "retrieve", since there is no "c" before it, you should use "**ie**."
